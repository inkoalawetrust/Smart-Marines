Ok, I was able to finally begin working on these god forsaken NPCs for the first time in months, turns out
they are somehow broken again, so I have to rewrite them for the FOURTH time, so I'm just going to keep
this document of what they should be able to do around. The list is roughly ordered from most to least important.

19/8/2021: And the fourth iteration met the same fate, wunderbar. This project is genuinely cursed, and it is physically impossible to convince me otherwise.
16/1/2022: While working on my gz_bigcity map, which was originally made just to showcase them after I thought the fifth iteration finally worked. I noticed that they wouldn't attack every time I spanwed one in. So I have to uselessly rewrite them again.


NOTE: Try using class extensions, and hope those allow me to split the behaviour into (Hopefully) easier to fix chunks, that I won't forget how they work.| Done, thank god.| Every time I get optimistic I am beaten down back to constant pessimism.
NOTE: Each of these goals or whatever, test them THOROUGHLY TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO BUGS.| Done, no major bugs are on them now AFAIK| No bugs my ass

An asterisk (*) before the = means that I finished that goal on the current iteration of the marine NPCs.
An x means it was cancelled for whatever reason.

=THIS SHOULD BE THE FINAL TIME I HAVE TO REFACTOR THEM.| DONE, FINALLY | NOT DONE, THEY BROKE AGAIN, IT WILL NEVER BE DONE

*=Be able to forget their target after a set amount of time, the time it takes should be exposed to a user variable, a value of 0 means they will not stop chasing their target.
*==If their target is forgotten, they should begin wandering around until they find a new one, while doing so, they should have a chance to enter a state
   in which they stand around for a random amount of time before beginning to move again.

*=They should fire in 5 round bursts, and need to reload after firing 20 rounds, the latter should be able to be turned off too. | Done, but the burst fire was removed, since them randomly changing position does the same thing, without needing to overcomplicate the code.
*==A bit less important, but they should try 2 or 3 times to run away from their target, to somewhere where their target can't see them, before reloading,
   if they fail to hide all 3 times, then just reload in the open. Make this particular behaviour controllable with a user variable.

*=Add the basic states like Pain, Death, XDeath etc. | Done, and multiple death AND raise states where added too.

*=They should be able to throw grenades.
*==They should have a random chance to throw a grenade, they will throw it if the random throwing chance exceeds a threshold that can be user configurable.
*==Besides the random chance, the number that needs to exceed the threshold should also be increased by 1-2 for every killable enemy around the target
   the marine will toss the grenade to.
*==There should be a user variable to totally turn the grenade throwing off.
*==They should run away if they are within the blast radius of any of their grenades.

*=Add marine palette translations, such as ones that make him blue, red, purple etc, and that can be set to each marine using a User_Color string variable.
*==Also add a special "random" string, that makes the marine pick a random color.

*=Add a User_RandomPersonality variable, which randomizes other user variables to generate a unique marine, such as one that is very likely to throw grenades,
 never stops chasing their target, and doesn't swim. I should add this for last, once the rest of the list is done.
*==The randomization code should be called before the variables are initialized, so variables can be prevented from being randomized by the mapper.

x=They should be able to swim across swimmable 3D floors if their target is on the other side. This should be toggleable.| Cancelled, the code is too janky even compared to the rest of the marine code, and I still have no swimming sprites for them even.
x==They will do that by jumping into the water and swimming on the surface, then jumping out the other side.
X==Add the ability for them to drown if they are fully submerged for too long, then reset the drown timer once on the surface again, Make the timers' max value into a user variable.

x=See about adding taunts to the marines, obviously it should be toggleable too, along with the chance of them doing it.

*=Make pressing use on a marine put it on its' wander state, and pressing use again put it back to its' Spawn state. But only when the marine has no target.

*=Improve the rifle and shit, add overlays and all that good stuff too, now that I have a new PC.| Done, the zooming effects are a mess internally.

*=Marines that are alerted, will also alert other nearby marines that are on their side of the target.

*=Make them able to get scared of any large monsters like Cyberdemons they may be targeting. Should be easy enough to do.

*=Make placeable machine gun turrets.
*==These turrets will have infinite ammo, and thrice the fire rate and damage of the marines' rifles.| Sort of done, I nerfed them because they were too OP by being more realistic lol.
*==When a marine is near one and sees multiple targets, or really powerful ones, he'll run up to it and man it, hopefully I'll be able to get them to walk up to a turret without too much hackery.
x===Worst case scenario I have to make them just keep facing the turret and walk in a straight line towards it.| Nah, I was able to use patrol goals instead.
*==When having manned a machine gun, the marine will have a random chance to leave it after not seeing any enemies for a few seconds.
*==Make a seperate actor that has the marine already on the turret, and leave the turret unmanned once killed.
*==I uh, aren't sure how I'll code it to be usable by the player :badpokerface:|Lewisk3 coded it to be usable by players.

=MAKE A MARINE WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER.
==Make firing states for the rocket launcher with fire coming out.
==Don't forget to crop out and add his pain frames in the file, once I make the firing sprites though, and know what frame name to give to his pain sprites.
==Make a custom rocket model, yes me, that's right, I'll try to learn Blender to make a rocket with different pitches.
*==Figure out how to make the back facing sprites of the marine actually show the rocket launcher.| Done, TG5 redid all the sprites.
==Make the rocket launcher into a standalone sprite that can be picked up, and which rolls up in the air after the marine is killed.| Sprite made by me.

=Make marine snipers, with spotters.
==The spotters spawn near the marine after he is spawned or placed in the map. You can disable the spawning of the spotter.
==When the sniper has a spotter, he will not look for enemies on his own, instead the spotter looks for enemies, and transfers his target pointer to the sniper once he finds one, for the sniper to shoot him.
==The sniper rifle emits a red laser line to where the bullet will go, probably using a custom railgun attack. The laser can be turned off.
==If his spotter is killed, he'll begin to find and attack targets on his own, but becomes considerably more inaccurate.
==The spotter carries an SMG that he can attack with if an enemy is too close.
==Both the marine and spotter look for the strongest target they can see, but you can set them to look for the nearest one instead, or to shoot random enemies if you want to for some reason.
==They are both crouched normally, only getting up to move, or attack really close enemies.
==Perhaps I can make them able to move to occasionaly move to predefined, map placeable sniper spots.
==The sniper shot is incredibly damaging, obviously.
==The snipers' editor sprite should be of both him and the spotter crouched next to each other.
==And optional flanker who can be turned on to also spawn near a map placed sniper, who is basically a standard AI marine.

-------|DO THE ABOVE FIRST, THEN WE CAN SEE ABOUT THE REST|-------

Other ideas (DO THE ABOVE FIRST)

=Crouching mode, if they are going to walk into a sector is lower than the standard height, then they should change their height and enter into alternate
 crouched versions of their normal firing, walking, pain etc states. This isn't as important, like literally should be the last thing I do.
==Make sure to replace the old ZDoom sprites with the new ones TG5 made, and to credit him obviously.
