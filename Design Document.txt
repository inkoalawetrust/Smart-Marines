Ok, I was able to finally begin working on these god forsaken NPCs for the first time in months, turns out
they are somehow broken again, so I have to rewrite them for the FOURTH time, so I'm just going to keep
this document of what they should be able to do around. The list is roughly ordered from most to least important.

19/8/2021: And the fourth iteration met the same fate, wunderbar. This project is genuinely curse, and it is physically impossible to convince me otherwise.


NOTE: Try using class extensions, and hope those allow me to split the behaviour into (Hopefully) easier to fix chunks, that I won't forget how they work.
NOTE: Each of these goals or whatever, test them THOROUGHLY TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO BUGS.

An asterisk (*) before the = means that I finished that goal on the current iteration of the marine NPCs.

=THIS SHOULD BE THE FINAL TIME I HAVE TO REFACTOR THEM.

*=Be able to forget their target after a set amount of time, the time it takes should be exposed to a user variable, and include one to turn this off totally too.
*==If their target is forgotten, they should begin wandering around until they find a new one, while doing so, they should have a chance to enter a state
   in which they stand around for a random amount of time before beginning to move again.

*=They should fire in 5 round bursts, and need to reload after firing 20 rounds, the latter should be able to be turned off too.
*==A bit less important, but they should try 2 or 3 times to run away from their target, to somewhere where their target can't see them, before reloading,
   if they fail to hide all 3 times, then just reload in the open. Maybe make this particular behaviour toggleable with a user variable.

*=Add the basic states like Pain, Death, XDeath etc.

*=They should be able to throw grenades.
*==They should have a random chance to throw a grenade, they will throw it if the random throwing chance exceeds a threshold that can be user configurable.
*==Besides the random chance, the number that needs to exceed the threshold should also be increased by 1-2 for every killable enemy around the target
   the marine will toss the grenade to.
*==There should be a user variable to totally turn the grenade throwing off.
*==They should run away if they are within the blast radius of any of their grenades.

*=Add marine palette translations, such as ones that make him blue, red, purple etc, and that can be set to each marine using a User_Color string variable.
*==Also add a special "random" string, that makes the marine pick a random color.

*=Add a User_RandomPersonality variable, which randomizes other user variables to generate a unique marine, such as one that is very likely to throw grenades,
 never stops chasing their target, and doesn't swim. I should add this for last, once the rest of the list is done.
==The randomization code should be called before the variables are initialized, so variables can be prevented from being randomized by the mapper.


-------|DO THE ABOVE FIRST, THEN WE CAN SEE ABOUT THE REST|-------

Other ideas (DO THE ABOVE FIRST)

=They should be able to swim across swimmable 3D floors if their target is on the other side. This should be toggleable.
==They will do that by jumping into the water and swimming on the surface, then jumping out the other side.
==Add the ability for them to drown if they are full submerged for too long, then reset the drown timer once on the surface again, Make the timers' max value into a user variable.

=Crouching mode, if they are going to walk into a sector is lower than the standard height, then they should change their height and enter into alternate
 crouched versions of their normal firing, walking, pain etc states. This isn't as important, like literally should be the last thing I do.

=Improve the rifle and shit, add overlays and all that good stuff too, now that I have a new PC.
