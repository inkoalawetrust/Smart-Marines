#URGENT: I have no idea what I'm doing LMAO. But this is here as a reference for what the voice pack syntax
#will probably look like, and hopefully I'll figure out how to parse it into usable data to put in a struct.
#Then stuff that struct in an array in KAI_EventHandler. No idea where the parsing should even take place,
#OnEngineInitialize() ? Probably not, since it shouldn't need to be re-parsed if reloading an existing save !

#These sounds are stored in a struct stored on the NPC, and then you can pass a type like TYPE_SIGHT in a
#SayVoiceLine() function available to KAI_Humanoid to play the voice pack sound you want.
#That way the voice packs are handled automatically, but you and I decide how the sounds are used in our NPCs.
