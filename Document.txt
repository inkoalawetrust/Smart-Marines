The credits for this NPC and his rifle can be found inside the credits.txt document.

The marines have 120 health, only a bit higher than the players'. You can just turn on the Friendly flag for them in the editor to use them as smart allies.
In fact, I've sort of just made them with the intent of being used as allies, like the Allied Marines resource from Realm667.

================|USER VARIABLES|================
User variables allow an actor to be configured by the mapper through the editor on a per-actor basis, without requiring the modify the source code of the actor in any way.
If you don't know how to use and/or change the user variables of an actor, then click on this Imgur album to see how: https://imgur.com/a/IF9Ezo2

User_Color: A text input field, that allows you to type in one of several premade colors to set the marines' armor to, those include: Red, Gray, White, Black, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Pink. You can type random to give the marine a random color.
User_AttentionSpan: How long the marine will chase his target before losing it, the higher the number, the longer he'll chase. Default is 200.
User_Persistent: If on, makes the marine chase his target indefinitely, and negates User_AttentionSpan.
User_GrenadeThreshold: How likely the marine is to throw a grenade, the lower the number, the more likely he is to throw one. Default is 240.
User_NoGrenade: If on, the marine will never throw grenades, negates User_GrenadeThreshold.
User_NoMelee: If on, the marine will never bash enemies with his rifle in melee range.
User_NoReload: If on, the marine never needs to reload his gun.
User_NoRetreat: If on, the marine will not try to first get out of sight from his target before reloading.

User_RandomPersonality: If on, it will randomize any above variable that could be seen as having to do with each marines' personality.
For example, if you turned it on for a group of marines, they will now:
- Have varying predispositions to throw grenades at enemies.
- Each chase a target for a different amount of time.
- Each of them may or may not, use melee attacks, retreat to reload, and throw grenades at all, or any combination of those.
Note: NoReload isn't randomized, because having a gun with an endless magazine isn't a personality trait. User_Persistent isn't randomly changed
because it would mean that some marines just always know where their target is at all times somehow.

================|DETAILS ON HOW THE MARINES ACTUALLY WORK|================
This information is included here to get a better grasp of how the marine works to use them on your maps and mods more effectively.

Their target chasing and losing behaviour uses an internal timer, if User_Persistent is off and they have a target, that timer will begin to increment if
they cannot see or hear their target, but if they do see or hear the target again, the timer will reset. If the timer increments above the value of
User_AttentionSpan, then the marine will lose track of his target and wander around until he finds another one.

The marine is more likely to throw a grenade at a strong enough target, and even more likely to throw one depending on how many other enemies are around
that target and would be caught in the grenades' blast radius. Lowering the value of User_GrenadeThreshold increases the chance to toss a grenade even more.
