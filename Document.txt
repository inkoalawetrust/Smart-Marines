NOTE: THE MARINES ARE STILL USING PLACEHOLDER SPRITES FOR DIVING AND SWIMMING, I WILL TRY TO ADD PROPER SPRITES WHENEVER I CAN GET MY HANDS ON THEM.

The credits for this NPC, his rifle and machine gun turret, can be found inside the credits.txt document.

If you have any issues with the marines or some other NPC made by me, you can ask me for help on Discord at inkoalawetrust#9783, or Twitter at @inkoalawetrust.

The marines have 120 health, only a bit higher than the players'. You can just turn on the Friendly flag for them in the editor to use them as smart allies.
In fact, I've sort of just made them with the intent of being used as allies, like the Allied Marines resource from Realm667.

================|WHAT THEY CAN DO|================

Attack stuff by:
- Bashing it with their rifle. (Melee)
- Shoot at it in bursts of 5 rounds. (Ranged)
- Throw a grenade at it, more likely to throw it at crowds of enemies. (Area of effect) 
Run away from their own grenades.

Reload their rifles for every 20 rounds they fire in total.
- They first try a few times to run away from their target until out of sight, to not reload while vulnerable.
Chase around their target for some time before losing track of it, if they can't hear or see it for too long.

When not set to friendly, they attack friendly NPCs on sight, unlike normal enemy NPCs/monsters, that don't attack friendly NPCs unless provoked by them first.
Can swim across swimmable 3D sectors to reach their target.

Can be frightened if their target is big and/or strong enough.

Can have a chance to taunt and wave their rifle after killing a powerful NPC, player, or a lot of weaker enemies*.

Has placeable machine gun turrets that both players and the marines can use, you can press the use key on a friendly marine to get him off of one.

Includes a seperate marine that permanently stays on the turret until killed, who can also be colored like below. Pressing use on him doesn't get him off.

You can press the use key on friendly marines when they are in their initial spawn state, to get them to move.

Can be colored with a variety of colors:
- Red
- Gray
- White
- Black
- Blue
- Yellow
- Orange
- Pink
- Random (Randomly pick a color.)
Can have a randomized personality, that gives the marine a random armor color, different attention spans and chances to throw a grenade etc.

Most of the marines' behaviour can be configured on a per actor basis using user variables. More on that on the below section.

They also have a rifle that they sometimes drop, which you can pick up and use yourself.
- The rifle fires bursts of 5 rounds, and needs reloading after firing 20 rounds, just like when the marines use them. You can reload before the magazine fully runs out too.
- It also features animated digital sights complete with an animation for looking in and out of them, using the sights increased you accuracy as well.

*Such as Imps and Pinkies, anything that is really weak (5 or less HP), won't even count as a kill for the marine, so they won't be dancing afer killing 40 flies.

================|USER VARIABLES|================
User variables allow an actor to be configured by the mapper through the editor on a per-actor basis, without requiring the modify the source code of the actor in any way.
If you don't know how to use and/or change the user variables of an actor, then click on this Imgur album to see how: https://imgur.com/a/IF9Ezo2

User_Color: A text input field, that allows you to type in one of several premade colors to set the marines' armor to, those include: Red, Gray, White, Black, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Pink. You can type random to give the marine a random color.
User_AttentionSpan: How long the marine will chase his target before losing it, the higher the number, the longer he'll chase. Default is 200.
User_Persistent: Makes the marine chase his target indefinitely, and negates User_AttentionSpan.
User_GrenadeThreshold: How likely the marine is to throw a grenade, the lower the number, the more likely he is to throw one. Default is 240.
User_NoGrenade: If on, the marine will never throw grenades, negates User_GrenadeThreshold.
User_NoMelee: If on, the marine will never bash enemies with his rifle in melee range.
User_NoReload: If on, the marine never needs to reload his gun.
User_NoRetreat: If on, the marine will not try to first get out of sight from his target before reloading.
User_NoSwim: If on, the marine will not swim when in water or to reach his target.
User_Fearless: If on, the marine will not be scared of big and/or strong enough enemies that they are targeting.
User_NoTaunt: If on, the marine will not have a chance to taunt after killing a powerful enemy or a player.
User_NoMookTaunt: The marine will not have a chance to taunt after killing enough mook enemies, if you don't know what that is, check out this TV Tropes article: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks
User_DontUseTurrets: The marine won't go to and use any turrets near him for any reason.

User_RandomPersonality: If on, it will randomize any above variable that could be seen as having to do with each marines' personality. Setting a value for a variable stops it from being randomized.
For example, if you turned it on for a group of marines, they will now:
- Have varying predispositions to throw grenades at enemies.
- Each chase a target for a different amount of time.
- Each of them may or may not, use melee attacks, retreat to reload, and throw grenades at all, or any combination of those.
Note: NoReload isn't randomized, because having a gun with an endless magazine isn't a personality trait. User_Persistent isn't randomly changed
because it would mean that some marines just always know where their target is at all times somehow.

================|DETAILS ON HOW THE MARINES ACTUALLY WORK|================
This information is included here to get a better grasp of how the marine works to use them on your maps and mods more effectively.

Their target chasing and losing behaviour uses an internal timer, if User_Persistent is off and they have a target, that timer will begin to increment if
they cannot see or hear their target, but if they do see or hear the target again, the timer will reset. If the timer increments above the value of
User_AttentionSpan, then the marine will lose track of his target and wander around until he finds another one.

The marine is more likely to throw a grenade at a strong enough target, and even more likely to throw one depending on how many other enemies are around
that target and would be caught in the grenades' blast radius. Lowering the value of User_GrenadeThreshold increases the chance to toss a grenade even more.


================|THE ASSAULT RIFLE|================
When a marine dies, you may have noticed that they drop a rifle, or you just noticed it in the editor.

The buttons you need to use this rifle are the standard fire button, the reload button, and zoom button, if you don't have the latter two specified,
you have to go to Options>Customize Controls>Weapon, and bind those actions to keys, usually they are mapped to R and Z respectively.

The rifle is based on the rifle that Doomguy and the former humans carry, it fires 5 shots at a time, and has a
20 round magazine, it also has digital sights that you can look through with the zoom key, which increase your accuracy.

================|THE MACHINE GUN TURRET|================
A machine gun turret that can be placed down by mappers (Or just spawned through the console obviously.) is also included, if one is near a marine and
there are enough enemies around or at least on really powerful enemy. The marine will run up to it and use it, once every enemy is dead the marine will
then eventually leave the turret, the player is also able to use the turret, and can get a friendly marine in one to leave it by pressing the use key.
There is also a variant of the marine that is on the turret and always stays on it until killed. And has a User_TurretMarineColor variable, that behaves exactly like User_Color.
